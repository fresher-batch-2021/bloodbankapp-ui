            Have you at anytime witnessed a relative of yours or a close friend searching frantically for a blood donor,
            when blood banks say out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach and the time keeps ticking? Have you
            witnessed loss of life for the only reason that a donor was not available at the most needed hour? Is it
            something that we as a society can do nothing to prevent? This thought laid our foundation.
